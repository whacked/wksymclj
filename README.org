* gotchas

if you are running a =cljs-repl=, and
1. add a new dependency
2. refresh lein repl and cljsbuild
3. reload =cljs-repl=
4. whatever you eval in the cljs-repl throws e.g.
   =#object[ReferenceError ReferenceError: cuerdas is not defined]=

make sure you also reloaded the node environment (like electron)

* TODO problem with current tiddlers

  - [ ] anonymous tiddlers are incomprehensible from tiddlymap
  - [ ] need way to show related but not graph-linked nodes
        - programmatically
        - when visiting a node
  - [ ] need a git diff amenable renderer
